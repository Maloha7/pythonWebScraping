# Learning basic web scraping with python and BeautifulSoup

In this project i learned the basics of web scraping using python and BeatuifulSoup. I followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0) from youtube to learn how to find elements in a html page. Then I used what i learned to find information about upcoming events from the [home page](https://echo.uib.no/) of the student organization for informatics at the university of Bergen; "Echo".
